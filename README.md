## About
I am a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences (CLPS) at Brown University. 

While I am interested in many aspects of human language, I am most intrigued to investigate the "phonology - lexicon - processing" chain. Here is my intuition: the phonological system of a language could shape its lexicon as a collection of sound-meaning mappings, and the distributional features of the lexicon could influence how adults process the words and how young kids learn the words. 

My current project is about the distribution of homophones ("knight" and "night") in English, Mandarin and Japanese, and how native speakers of these languages resolve such ambiguity in speech. You can find more research ideas I want to pursue in "Research".
