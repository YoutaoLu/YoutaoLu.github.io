## Youtao Lu

Thank you for visiting my personal webpage!
I am currently a doctoral student of the Department of Cognitive, Linguistic and Psychological Sciences (CLPS) at Brown University. 
While I am interested in many aspects of human language, I am mostly focusing how spoken words are processed by adults and learnt by young kids, 
and how these differ across languages. 
My current project investigates the processing of homophones (words that are pronounced the same but mean different things, like "knight" and "night") 
within and without contexts in English, Mandarin and Japanese. 
I am planning to start a new project which will look at the relationship between the complexity of phonological systems and potential expectations 
(e.g. word length, tolerence of ambiguity)
